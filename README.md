# ***Recommendations:***

---

1. The EDA suggests that count of cycle rented is very low during season 1. **Yulu can rollout some challenges during this season, like New year goals on fitness and roll out exciting prizes for people participating in this season**.

2. The count of cycle is very low during the night hours. **Yulu can introduce some safety features in its app and also some promotional discounts for people renting yulu bikes from 12am - 6am**, which can motivate people to ride Yulu bikes during this time frame.

3. The count of bikes rented on holidays are significantly lower than on non-holidays. **Yulu can set up bike centers near entertainment hotspots, like malls and amusemennt parks to hike up its rental count on weekends and holidays.**

4. The EDA proves that Temperature, humidity, windspeed and weather - all these environmental factors affect the count of bikes rented on Yulu. Even though Yulu can not change the weather conditions, **Yulu can offer reduced pricing for people renting in these weather conditions (weather 2 & 3).**

5. Yulu can introduce exclusive benifits for registered users to get more users to register, which can pull up the amount of cycles rented per hour.

6. Yulu can introduce some early biker scheme (4am -7am), **that would target the people who are motivated in physical fitness and also roll out some exciting prizes for people covering the longest distance rides**.
